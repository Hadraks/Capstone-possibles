# Capstone-possibles


1)	NBME: National Board of Medical Examiners
This is a current contest in Kaggle given by the National Board of Medical Examiners and is an NLP and classification problem. These are notes taken from people trying to get licensed in medicine. The contest started a week ago and you have to do a series of predictions about medical relevance of their notes. 
14,000 notes given in tests which were later scored by other doctors.
I am interested in NLP and think I would learn something about medicine and the data set seems to have a real world use.

2)	NLP of tweets: https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started
This is a series of tweets where you are given the text and possible location and determine whether or not the text is describing a natural disaster. It seems an entry level problem so maybe I should trying something harder. At least one person has scored 100% so it may be too easy.

3)	World happiness scores
I am interested in connecting the world happiness scores with national statistics like GDP, latitude, government style, world transparency ratings, and 
proximity to other happy countries. This would involve a lot of joining data sets together and some of the data would be “squishy” such as government type or “at war”. This would be a time series problem involving logistic regression or other analyses to determine the relationships between a variable and the result.
It would be interesting to see which factors are leading or lagging indicators and what are the components of the “secret sauce” of a “happy” country.

4)	Outside option regarding COVID and involves predicting covid cases one week out. This data is from a year ago and the contest has already finished. Another option is simply doing it myself based on Johns Hopkins or another database and predict COVID one or two weeks out for county depending on factors like vaccination rate, prior levels, education level, etc. I would probably start with something like a train test split but have the train everything leading up to a date and then predict the Covid results for the next week and maybe do that a few times leading up to present.
